## Study Hive

## üí° Inspiration:

Due to Covid-19, people were under quarantine, they couldn't meet and socialize freely. Social distancing has led to depression, anxiety and other mental issues. The situation is worse for some people who are introverts. However, many people want to make friends (including introverts who want to become better), and they do not know how to socialize with other people and where to start. To decrease depression and other mental problems, we believe socialization is the best way to promote healthy connections and mental development.

## üíª What it does

This app connects with people based on learning commons and distance between the users. For example, a person who is studying calculus will most likely get matched with another person who is studying fields related to calculus or mathematics. The app promotes both effective studying and socializing at the same time by sharing each other‚Äôs knowledge. When one is stuck in a particular theory, discussion leads to social interaction and sharing feelings that promote socialization with each other. It‚Äôs the user‚Äôs opinion to choose whether they want to meet in-person, which is the recommended option (since human contact is not involved, there is no strong social interaction involved which reconnection after the first meeting is not going to happen) or talk through a video-conference program. Before each user joins the conversation, the app will give some suggestions on how to socialize with other people with a checklist and questions. For example, the app can suggest to the user to say ‚ÄúGood Morning‚Äù nicely to anyone, whoever he/she meets. Alternatively, the app also has a reward system based on how many social points the user earns in a period of time.

## üí≠ What can be added : If we have time, we will do this!!

Recommend good places to study to the clients
One part that has fun questions, allowing the people to get to know one another (tie into psychology)
Reward system, it is going to promote socialization. The app encourages people to socialize and make connections. If they achieve a goal, they will gain points or badges. (It can be self-reflection)

## ‚öôÔ∏èHow we built it

Figma

### Web App

- Frontend: React Js, Typescript
- Backend: Flask
- Authentication: Firebase

## üß† Challenges we ran into

Different time zones: Due to the difference in time zones it was a bit difficult to collaborate, but we managed it.
Some of our teammates who are beginners felt overwhelmed because they did not know how to relate their skills to the sorts of projects being worked on.
We wanted to build a user login system with Flask and create a user database using SQLite3, from which we can compare the current user input with the database to identify new and coming back users. However, we didn‚Äôt have enough time
We wanted to use the username as the primary key and a URL link to a picture instead of a password for login information, but we did not accomplish this.

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of

Everyone worked hard to complete the project as much as possible
Each team member learned a lot from their field of interest
Defeating the barriers put up by different time zones.

## üìñ What we learned

We learned the importance of collaboration and dedication between team members

## üöÄ What's next for Study Hive?

Study Hive can be expanded to be a study mentor-mentee working platform.
People can also upload their vlogs, tutorials and videos in different educational topics, from which they get points from views or gifts from other users.
If possible, we can expand the StudyHive to Play Hive, Work Hive or Food Hive. To explain, people can connect not just through there
