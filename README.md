## üí° Inspiration:
Due to Covid-19, people were under quarantine, they couldn't meet and socialize freely. Social distancing has led to depression, anxiety and other mental issues. The situation is worse for some people who are introverts. However, many people want to make friends (including introverts who want to become better), and they do not know how to socialize with other people and where to start. To decrease depression and other mental problems, we believe socialization is the best way to promote healthy connections and mental development. 

## üíª What it does
This app connects with people based on learning commons and distance between the users. For example, a person who is studying calculus will most likely get matched with another person who is studying in fields that are related to calculus or mathematics. The app promotes both effective studying and socializing at the same time by sharing each other‚Äôs knowledge. When one is stuck in a particular theory, discussion between the app users lead to social interaction and sharing feelings that promote socialization with each other. It‚Äôs the user‚Äôs opinion to choose whether they want to meet in-person, which is the recommended option (when human contact is not involved, there is no strong social interaction involved between the app users which reconnection between the app users after the first meeting is not going to happen) or talk through a video-conference program. Before each user joins the conversation, the app will give some suggestions on how to socialize with other people with a checklist and questions. For example, the app can suggest to the user to say ‚ÄúGood Morning‚Äù nicely to anyone, whoever he/she meets. Alternatively, the app also has a reward system based on how many social points the user earns in a period of time.

## üí≠ What can be added in the future
Recommend good places to study to the clients (This can be a way to make profit by advertising for the restaurants or cafe).
One part that has fun questions, allowing the people to get to know one another (tie into psychology)
Reward system, it is going to promote socialization. The app encourages people to socialize and make connections. If they achieve a goal, they will gain points or badges. (It can be self-reflection)
Supporting multiple-platforms! Currently, android apps are only tested, however, the use of Flutter which is a cross-platform programming language allows us to build different platform apps rapidly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

### Web App
Frontend: React JS, Typescript
Backend: Flask
Authentication: Firebase

### Mobile App
Frontend: Dart (Framework: Flutter)
Backend: Flask
Authentication: Flask

## üß† Challenges we ran into
Different time zones: Due to the difference in time zones it was a bit difficult to collaborate, but we managed it.
Some of our teammates who are beginners felt overwhelmed because they did not know how to relate their skills to the sorts of projects being worked on.
No programming languages in common: There were no common language for our team except Python. So if we face a problem, we need to solve by ourselves.
We wanted to build a user login system with Flask and create a user database using SQLite3, from which we can compare the current user input with the database to identify new and coming back users. However, we didn‚Äôt have enough time
We wanted to use the username as the primary key and a URL link to a picture instead of a password for login information, but we did not accomplish this.

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of
Everyone worked hard to complete the project as much as possible
Each team member learned a lot from their field of interest
Defeating the barriers put up by different time zones.
Be organized and helped each other whenever someone in the team need help.
Everyone was super enthusiastic, having motivated learning and coding environment.
It‚Äôs Amazing project! We are proud to say that we made most of the project within a short period of time!

## üìñ What we learned
We learned the importance of collaboration and dedication between team members
We learned how to be organized and be efficient.
Learn other cultures and respect each other more carefully.
We learned many technical skills such as Flask and different APIs. A large part of this project was to use REST-API to connect between the client and the server to retrieve the data from the API.
Design UI skills by using Figma for our website and mobile app prototype.

## üöÄ What's next for Study Hive?
Study Hive can be expanded to be a study mentor-mentee working platform.
People can also upload their vlogs, tutorials and videos in different educational topics, from which they get points from views or gifts from other users.
If possible, we can expand the Study Hive to Play Hive, Work Hive or Food Hive. To explain, people can connect not just through there
Study Hive app can give some advice on how to socialize.
